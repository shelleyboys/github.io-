    <h3>Before School Days</h3>
    <p>
        Basketball has been a part of his life from the very beginning. Even before he started school, 
        you could find him with a ball in his hands—dribbling in the driveway, shooting on a plastic 
        hoop in the living room, and watching games with wide eyes like he was already studying the sport. 
        Those early days were filled with endless energy, determination, and a pure love for the game. 
        By the time most kids were just learning their ABCs, he was already learning how to pass, 
        dribble, and shoot. That early passion set the foundation for everything he’s accomplished on the court today.
