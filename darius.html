    <h3>Before School Days</h3>
    <p>
        Basketball has been a part of his life from the very beginning. Even before he started school, 
        you could find him with a ball in his hands, dribbling in the driveway, shooting on a plastic 
        hoop in the living room, and watching games with wide eyes like he was already studying the sport. 
        Those early days were filled with endless energy, determination, and a pure love for the game. 
        By the time most kids were just learning their ABCs, he was already learning how to pass, 
        dribble, and shoot. That early passion set the foundation for everything he’s accomplished on the court today.

            <h3>Kindergarden Basketball Beginnings</h3>
            <p>Even in kindergarten, he was already showing a love for basketball that couldn’t be contained. He practiced layups on the small court, learned to dribble and pass, and quickly picked up the basics of the game. His determination and energy paid off when he earned his very first trophy—an exciting moment that marked the start of a lifelong basketball journey. Holding that trophy, it was clear that this little player had big dreams on the court </p>

            <h3>Darius' Journey Continues</h3>
            <p>By 3rd and 4th grade, Darius had already taken a big step forward in his basketball journey. He joined AAO Basketball in Fayetteville, where practices and games pushed him to sharpen his skills and learn what it meant to play at a higher level. During the summers, he hit the court with Takeover Academy, competing in Hardwood Tournaments that gave him a taste of real competition and teamwork on a bigger stage.
These years weren’t just about learning drills; they were about building confidence, handling tough games, and growing into a player who could hold his own against strong opponents. Every tournament, every game, and every practice added another layer to his development and his love for basketball.</p>
