            <p>
                Da’Marius brings imagination to life through arts and crafts, and now 3D printing adds a whole new dimension to his creativity. 
                Whether he’s painting, building models, designing handmade projects, or bringing digital ideas into the physical world with 3D prints, 
                he loves experimenting with colors, textures, and forms. Each creation shows his curiosity, problem-solving skills, and determination 
                to see every idea through to completion, blending traditional creativity with modern technology.

            <h3>Sports – Basketball, Football & Friendly Competitions</h3>
            <p>
                Sports have always been part of Da’Marius’ life, from shooting hoops to running the field in football. 
        While basketball and football are just part of his world, he approaches every game with energy, focus, and a drive to improve. 
        Da’Marius also enjoys fishing, showing patience, skill, and a love for being outdoors. 
        Beyond the court, field, and water, he has a knack for winning raffles and watermelon-eating contests, 
        showing that his competitive spirit and fun-loving attitude extend to everything he does. 
        Playing sports teaches him teamwork, perseverance, and the joy of celebrating effort as much as achievement.
