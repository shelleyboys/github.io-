            <h2>Meet Darius & Da’Marius</h2>
            <p>
                Darius is a dedicated basketball player whose passion for the game started in kindergarten. 
                From early trophies to league play and tournaments, his focus and determination on the court 
                continue to grow as he works toward his athletic goals, including Athlete of the Year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Da’Marius also enjoys basketball, but his real strength is in his curiosity and drive to learn new things. 
                Whether it’s exploring new skills, taking on challenges, or finding creative ways to solve problems, 
                he has a natural ability to grow and adapt quickly. His journey is about more than sports. It’s about 
                embracing every opportunity to learn and succeed.
